# Timelapse Gen

**timelapse_gen** is a script that will watch directories listed in the config.yml for changes. Whenever a new photo is added, it will resize it as needed. Once enough photos for a 1-second video are present, it will stitch them together and then append the resulting video to the main time-lapse.
